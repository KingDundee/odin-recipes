    <h2>Baked Mac & Cheese Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Nothing beats a casserole dish filled with this <strong>creamy 3-cheese 
      Baked Macaroni.</strong> This recipe ensures that <strong>there is absolutely no 
      shortage of that delicious cheese sauce.</strong> (It's amazing how much 
      sauce the macaroni continues to absorb when it bakes, but this recipe 
      completely factors that in.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I love the combination of <strong>cheddar, gruyere, and gouda,</strong> but the cheese 
      combinations are endless. Feel free to keep it simple and stick to cheddar, 
      or add in as many additional cheese combinations as you want!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb. elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons flour</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon each: onion powder, pepper</li>
      <li>3 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded Gruyere</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Gouda</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 9 x 13-inch casserole dish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pro tip:</strong> <em>Shred the cheese from a block</em>. 
        It will melt and taste much better than packaged shredded cheese. 
        See notes for brand of cheese that I use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prep Work:</strong> Shred the cheese and toss to combine. 
        Reserve 2 cups for the top of the macaroni and use the remaining 4 cups 
        for the cheese sauce. Measure out remaining ingredients before beginning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>To Cook the Macaroni: Begin boiling salted pasta water</strong> for 
        the macaroni while you prepare the cheese sauce. Add the pasta to the boiling 
        water right around when you are letting the cream sauce reduce/thicken, before 
        adding the cheese. Refer to the package and cook it for 1 minute less than al dente. 
        Set a timer to avoid overcooking the macaroni.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>For the Cheese Sauce: Melt butter</strong> in a large pot over medium heat. 
        Use a silicone spatula to <strong>stir in the flour.</strong> Continue to stir for 2 minutes, 
        it should start to turn a light brown. <strong>Add the heavy cream/milk in small splashes</strong>, 
        stirring continuously. (If you add it too quickly you'll “break” the roux and the sauce will be thin.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Let it heat through and thicken while you boil the macaroni. Stir continuously during this time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the seasonings and hot sauce.</strong> <em>Remove from heat</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gradually sprinkle in 4 cups of shredded cheese.</strong> Stir continuously until 
        smooth and combined. If it seems too thick, add a splash of milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Once the macaroni is cooked, drain it</strong> and add it to the warm pot you boiled it in. 
        <strong>Pour the cheese sauce on top</strong> and stir to combine. Transfer to a lightly greased 
        9 x 13-inch casserole dish. <strong>Top with remaining 2 cups of cheese.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake for 20 minutes.</strong> If desired, broil at 450 for 3 minutes to brown the top. Serve!
