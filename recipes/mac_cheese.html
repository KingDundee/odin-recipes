        <p>
            Nothing beats a casserole dish filled with this <strong>creamy 3-cheese 
            Baked Macaroni.</strong> This recipe ensures that <strong>there is absolutely no 
            shortage of that delicious cheese sauce.</strong> (It's amazing how much 
            sauce the macaroni continues to absorb when it bakes, but this recipe 
            completely factors that in.)

            I love the combination of <strong>cheddar, gruyere, and gouda,</strong> but the cheese 
            combinations are endless. Feel free to keep it simple and stick to cheddar, 
            or add in as many additional cheese combinations as you want!
