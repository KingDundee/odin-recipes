    <p>
      This <em>perfect</em> French Toast formula has come about from much experimentation and is 
      almost too good to share!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup half & half</li>
      <li>1 loaf bread, (Brioche, Challah, or Country Loaf)</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Before you Start:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        It is advised to cut your loaf into 8 (1/2-inch slices). 
        Slices 1-inch in size do quite well also.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your slices are MUCH more likely to hold up well if you bake 
        them on wire racks at 300° for 8 minutes on each side. 
        If your bread is stale, this isn't as necessary, but fresh bread 
        has a better taste and can obtain the dry consistency that it needs by baking it.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making the French Toast:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
      <li>
        Heat the honey for 15 seconds in the microwave. Whisk it in a pie pan with the eggs, 
        salt, and half & half.
      </li>
      <li>Place a cooling rack on top of a sheet pan.</li>
      <li>
        Dip each side of the bread into the custard, allowing it to absorb for about 10 seconds, 
        (it will hold up well if it's been baked as noted above.)
      </li>
      <li>Place the bread on the cooling rack for 1-2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large pan over low heat.</li>
      <li>
        Place 2 slices of bread at a time in the pan and cook each side until golden brown, 
        about 2-3 minutes/side.
      </li>
      <li>Remove the bread from the pan and place on the middle rack in the oven for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Repeat for all slices. Serve immediately with syrup, fruit, and/or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
